<p> PROS OF PLAYING RENGAR  </p>
<ul>
	<li> Insanely fun to play </li>
	<li> High burst/One shotting </li>
	<li> Variation on Fero Spells </li>
	<li> Bush jump  </li>
	<li> Very adaptive </li>
</ul>
<p> Rengar is one of the best Solo Queue Jungler since he was released, due to his very unique Duel/Assassination Kit. He has the ability to 1v1 nearly every jungler in the early game and his clear speed is very good 
( he's even faster with his first camps than graves !). You won't get bored because you can play him in so many different ways and you have to adapt every game item/play style wise.
</p>
<br/>
<p> CONS OF PLAYING RENGAR </p>
<ul>
	<li> Hard to master </li>
	<li> Very unique play style </li>
	<li> Interruptible ult </li>
	<li> Ult only camouflage  </li>
	<li> Bad with enemy grouping </li>
</ul>
<p> Rengar is a double-edged sword, either you get ahead and stomp or you get stomped. It's hard to come back, if the enemy plays it correctly. He needs to engage and you will most likely die, 
when the targets you need to engage on won't get one shotted. So you have to try to get ahead early by utilizing your strengths and try to compensate your weaknesses.</p>

<p> <font size="+2"> ABOUT RENGAR </font> </p>
<p>  Starting with his passive:Unseen Predator EFFECT RADIUS: 50 SPEED: 1450  </p>
<img src="item pics/passive.PNG" alt="passive"/>
<p> INNATE: While in Brushmaker brush or Ambush 2 camouflaged, Rengar's basic attacks gain 600 bonus range and cause him to leap to enemies beyond his normal Melee role melee range. This bonus lasts 
for 0.5 seconds upon exiting brush or stealth. Leaping when on 0 Ferocity generates 1 Ferocity. </p>
<p> FEROCITY: Rengar generates 1 Ferocity whenever he casts a basic ability. Upon reaching 4 Ferocity his next basic ability is empowered, can be cast independently of its basic version's cooldown, 
incurs no cooldown of its own, grants Rengar 30% / 40% / 50% bonus movement speed for 1.5 seconds, and consumes all of his Ferocity. Reaching 4 Ferocity with Savagery or Bola Strike locks its empowered 
version for 0.1 seconds before and after casting it. All Ferocity is lost after being out-of-combat for 8 seconds.
</p>
<p> Bonetooth Necklace Green
BONETOOTH NECKLACE: Enemy champion Damage rating takedown, within 1.5 seconds of being damaged by Rengar, grants him a Trophy, up to one per unique enemy champion and to a maximum of 5. An Head of Kha'Zix 
additional one is made available through the event The Hunt is On! Trophies grant 1% - 36% (based on Bonetooth Necklace Green trophies) bonus AD as bonus attack damage.</p>
<p> So basically you get Stacks for every Champion you damaged in the last 1.5 s and get bonus AD for them. You can look up which stacks you already got by hovering over the icon of the passive above your skills. 
But that's just a nice to have, the more important thing is that you get 1 ferocity whenever you use a skill. You get a Fero for free, when you have no ferocity and attack someone out of a bush or when you jump onto him.</p>
<p> Savagery Q: COOLDOWN: 6 / 5.5 / 5 / 4.5 / 4 </p>
<img src="item pics/Q.PNG" alt="Q"/>
<p> ACTIVE: Rengar's next two basic attacks within 3 seconds gain 40% bonus attack speed, with the first also dealing bonus Attack damage physical damage and having 25 bonus range.</p>
<p>  BONUS PHYSICAL DAMAGE:30 / 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 (+ 0 / 5 / 10 / 15 / 20% AD) </p>
<img src="item pics/Q2.PNG" alt="Q2"/> 
<p>  EMPOWERED ACTIVE: Savagery's bonus physical damage is increased to 30 - 240 (based on level) (+ 40% AD) and applying it grants Rengar 50% - 101% (based on level) bonus attack speed for 5 seconds. </p>
<p> Savagery resets Rengar's basic attack timer. </p>
<p> This Spell is where your DMG comes from. You use it to reset your AA, to speed up in your jungle when you have no camp to clear or you won't make it to the next one with full fero.
Your Fero Q gives your even more DMG and Attackspeed for the next 5 Seconds.</p>
<br/>
<p> Battle Roar W:	EFFECT RADIUS: 450 COOLDOWN: 16 / 14.5 / 13 / 11.5 / 10 </p>
<img src="item pics/W.PNG" alt="W"/> 
<p> PASSIVE: Rengar stores 50% of the damage he's taken in the last 1.5 seconds as Grey Health (75% versus monsters).</p>
<p> ACTIVE: Rengar lets out a battle roar, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies and Heal power healing Rengar for his Grey Health.</p>
<p> MAGIC DAMAGE:50 / 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 (+ 80% AP) </p>
<img src="item pics/W2.PNG" alt="W2"/>
<p> EMPOWERED ACTIVE: Battle Roar's base damage is modified to 50 - 220 (based on level) and additionally Cleanse cleanses. </p>
<p> Rengar's W is his backup/aoe spell. You store 50% of the damage you took in the last 1.5s and heal for this amount when you use your W. Your empowered W is also a Cleanse, so you can jump in do your combo and when you get
 stunned just press w and run out.</p>
<br/>
<p> Bola Strike E:	TARGET RANGE: 1000 COOLDOWN: 10 </p>
<img src="item pics/E.PNG" alt="E"/>
<p>  ACTIVE: Rengar throws a bola in the target direction, dealing physical damage to the first enemy hit and Slow icon slowing them for 1.75 seconds. </p>
<p>  PHYSICAL DAMAGE:55 / 100 / 145 / 190 / 235 (+ 80% bonus AD) </p>
<p> SLOW:30 / 45 / 60 / 75 / 90% </p>
<p> EMPOWERED ACTIVE: Bola Strike's base physical damage is increased to 50 - 305 (based on level) and using it Root icon roots its target for 1.75 seconds. </p>
<img src="item pics/E2.PNG" alt="E2"/> 
<p> Now to his only CC-Ability. Your E is a slow which gets stronger per point into it and when you throw a 4 Ferocity E onto someone, he's snared for 1,75s. </p>
<br/>
<p> Thrill of the Hunt R :	EFFECT RADIUS: 2500 / 3000 / 3500 COOLDOWN: 110 / 90 / 70  </p>
 <img src="item pics/R.PNG" alt="R"/>
<p>  ACTIVE: Rengar channels his predatory instincts, becoming Ambush 2 camouflaged after 2 seconds and gaining bonus movement speed for the duration. Attacking or casting most spells ends Thrill of the Hunt. </p>
<p>  CAMOUFLAGE DURATION: 12 / 16 / 20  </p>
<p>  BONUS MOVEMENT SPEED:40 / 50 / 60% </p>
<p>  Rengar gains True Sight icon true sight of the nearest enemy champion, who he can leap to deal 50% AD bonus physical damage and reduce their armor for 4 seconds.</p>
<p>  ARMOR REDUCTION: 12 / 18 / 24 </p>
<p>  The nearest enemy champion to Rengar alerts all allies within 1200 range about his presence. </p>
<p>  This is the essential of Rengar's Kit which makes him a real Hunter. He gets one with his surrounding and enters camouflage mode. When Rengar is in Camo he gains movespeed, true sight on the nearest enemy, keeps
 it and can jump on someone. So you try to scout as much as you can before oneshotting. However if you come to close to the enemy, he will get an ! as a warning above his head, that you are near and marked him. You reduce the 
 Armor of the target you jump on and deal bonus damage when the target was marked. </p>
